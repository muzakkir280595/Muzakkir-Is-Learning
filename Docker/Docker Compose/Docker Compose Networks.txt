Docker Compose Networks
Docker Compose networks allow for communication between services. By default, Docker Compose defines a single network for all services described under docker-compose.yml. However, you can define your custom networks to better control inter-service communication.

Best Network Configuration Options
driver − This specifies the driver to be used in the network (e.g., bridge, overlay).
driver_opts − Options for the network driver.
ipam − Specifies the IP address management configurations like subnets and IP ranges.

Example:
networks:
   frontend:
      driver: bridge
   backend:
      driver: bridge

services:
   web:
      networks:
         - frontend

   api:
      networks:
         - frontend
         - backend

   db:
      networks:
         - backend
