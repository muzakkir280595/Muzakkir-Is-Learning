Docker Compose Services
Services in Docker Compose represent the containers comprising the user's application. Each service is defined in the `services` section of the `docker-compose.yml` file and has its configuration such as a Docker image to use, variables within the environment, ports, volumes, and network settings.

Key Service Configuration Options
Image − This field specifies the Docker image that should be used for the service.
Build − Specifies the directory for a build context, thus allowing the specification to make an image or not pull from a registry.
Ports − maps host ports to the container.
Volumes − Attach volumes to your service for persistent storage.
Environment − Services environment variables.
Depends_on − Defines service dependencies so they are started in the appropriate order.





Example:
services:
   app:
      image: myapp:latest
      build: .
      ports:
         - "8080:80"
      volumes:
         - app-data:/usr/src/app
      environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
      depends_on:
         - db

   db:
      image: postgres:latest
      environment:
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
