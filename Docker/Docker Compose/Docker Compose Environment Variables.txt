Docker Compose Environment Variables
Environment variables can be used in Docker Compose to pass configuration settings into services. These can be defined within a service's configuration as part of the `environment` section or loaded from an external file.

Basic Ways to Set Environment Variables
Inline − Register environment variables within your service definition.
env_file − This command allows environment variables to be loaded from an external file.

Example:
services:
   web:
      image: myapp:latest
      environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
         - API_KEY=12345

   database:
      image: postgres:latest
      env_file:
         - .env



in .env file:
POSTGRES_USER=myuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase
