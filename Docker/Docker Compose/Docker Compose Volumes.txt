Docker Compose Volumes
Docker Compose uses volumes to persist data created or consumed by Docker containers. The volumes section in the docker-compose.yml file defines all the volumes attached to services for storing data in a way that its lifecycle exists outside of the container.

Key Volume Configuration Options
External − Indicates whether the volume is created outside Docker Compose.
Driver − Specifies the volume driver to use.
Driver_opts − Options to configure the volume driver.


Example:

volumes:
   db-data:
   app-data:
      external: true

services:
   database:
      image: postgres:latest
      volumes:
         - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

   app:
      image: myapp:latest
      volumes:
         - app-data:/usr/src/app
